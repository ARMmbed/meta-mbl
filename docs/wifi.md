## Qualcomm WiFi

### Introduction

For legal reasons Arm is not permitted to redistribute the Qualcomm QCA9377 firmware.
The following is a brief description of how to install the firmware on an mbed Linux image.

#### Getting the firmware

A script has been supplied on the root filesystem which will download the requisite firmware.

Connect an Ethernet cable or bring up the USB Ethernet interface as described in [USB networking feature][mbl-usb-networking].

A script to add the WiFi driver to the device has been added to the MBL image at /etc/mbl-firmware.d/populate_rootfs_qca.sh.

It does this by either:

* Downloading it or
* Running a previously downloaded firmware on the rootfs

#### Sample log

root@mbed-linux-os-4345:~# cd /tmp/
