# mbl-os-0.10

Copyright Â© 2018-2019 Arm Limited.

We are pleased to announce that [Mbed Linux OS 0.10.0][mbl-release] is now available as a public preview release.

## Summary

This release is intended to enable customers to continue to validate the Mbed Linux operating system. This release is built upon the OpenEmbedded build automation framework and uses versions of OpenEmbedded and Third Party IP that are pinned for this release.

For more information about the features and product vision, please see the [introduction on our website][mbl-introduction].

## Changes

The main additions to 0.10 over 0.9:

* Multi-components (bootloaders, kernel, rootfs and apps) [OTA update support](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-linux-os/v0.10/update/index.html) via the Pelion device management or locally via MBL CLI.
    * **Note:** This change to the update feature requires an [upgrade process to be followed to upgrade from version 0.9 to version 0.10](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-linux-os/v0.10/update/updating-an-mbl-image.html#updating-across-releases-of-mbl). This process uses the `create-update-payload` script that was introduced in 0.9 and must be used to create the payloads. Updates will not be installed without using this tool.
* SSH connection only accepts Public Key Authentication on the debug ethernet interface on [production image](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-linux-os/v0.10/first-image/building-a-production-image.html).
* [Production images](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-linux-os/v0.10/first-image/building-a-production-image.html) have been reduced in size (about 10%) by removing unnecessary tools and services.

**Deprecation notice**

The Warp7 platform is deprecated.

The code for the Warp7 will not be removed from MBL OS but all building and testing of the platform is stopped.
Contributions to fix the platform can be submitted and will be reviewed and accepted in line with the [contribution policy][mbl-contrib].

The platform has been deprecated due to availability issues, export control limitations, and the ability to reliably automate testing in a test farm.
