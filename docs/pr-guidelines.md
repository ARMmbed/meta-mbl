# Pull Request Guidelines

Copyright Â© 2018-2019 Arm Limited.

Before you create a pull request from a branch, each commit on the branch
should be a logically self-contained change and must not break a build or any
functionality. You must not add unrelated changes in the same commit.

Each commit message should have:
* A subject and body conforming to [these guidelines][commit-message-guidelines].
* The subject **must not** contain any references to Arm internal IDs like: issue
  tracking, requirement, documentation, continuous integration and automated
  test job(s).
* The commit message body should contain the following references to Arm internal
  IDs when applicable: issue tracking, requirement and documentation.

When you create a pull request, please provide the following additional
information in the PR description or in a comment:
* The subject **must not** contain any references to Arm internal IDs like: issue
  tracking, requirement, documentation, continuous integration and automated
  test job(s).
* The description should contain a summary about the changes/commits that are
  included and any testing that you have done to validate the changes. If the PR
  has a dependency on another open PR, it should be mentioned. And if it needs to
  be synced with another PR from another repository, add the relevant PR link and
  the "SYNCHRONIZE MERGES" label.
* The description should contain the following information when applicable:
  issue tracking, requirement, documentation, continuous integration and
  automated test job(s) results.

Once a pull request has been made, it must be reviewed before being accepted.
If a reviewer requests changes to a pull request, they will probably do so
using GitHub's review tool, which allows adding review comments for individual
lines of code. Please:
* Respond to every comment, even if the response is just a "thumbs up" emoji
  (which means "I agree and will make the requested change.").
* Do not mark review comments as "resolved" - leave that to the person who
  left the comment.
* Do not reply to a review comment indicating that you have made a change until
  you have actually pushed that change to the pull request branch.
* Do not make additional changes that are not related to the original purpose
  of the PR.
  
Once a PR has been approved by all reviewers who requested changes, it is the
responsibility of the PR's author to merge it to the target branch. In the
case of lack of permission to merge, it is the responsibility of the last
reviewer who approved the PR, to merge it.

To make changes to a pull request branch we have two allowed processes:

### 1. Squash Flow: When the pull request initially contains a single commit

This should be the most common case (we prefer small pull requests) and is
strongly preferred.

When there is initially only one commit in a pull request:
* For each subsequent change to a pull request (e.g. arising from a reviewer's
  request for changes) a new commit is uploaded to the pull request.
  * I.e.: modify, `git add` and then `git commit`.
  * Commit messages made at this point don't always have to conform the
    guidelines stated above because they will be squashed into the first commit
    on the PR later. The purpose of the change should still be obvious from the
    pull request comments and the commit message.
  * When you intend for a new commit on a pull request to be squashed into the
    previous commit, prefix the subject line of the commit message with "TO BE
    SQUASHED:".
* There is an exception to the previous guideline when a pull request branch
  contains merge conflicts. In this case, you can fix merge conflicts
  by doing a rebase locally followed by a force-push. The force-push should
  only be used to fix merge conflicts and subsequent changes to the pull
  request branch should follow the previous guideline. You may also use
  GitHub's online merge conflict resolution process.
* Once we are happy with the set of commits in a pull request we use the
  `squash and merge` feature of GitHub to merge the changes. At this point the
  message for the final squash commit is created, based on the messages for
  each commit in the (pre-squash) pull request with any necessary amendments.
* The reviewer may ask for an updated commit message. To avoid changing the
  commits on the pull request branch, this new commit message should be posted
  as a comment which the reviewer will use when forming the message for the
  final squash commit.

### 2. Force Push Flow: When the pull request initially contains multiple commits

This should be the less common case.

If there are initially multiple commits in a pull request that shouldn't be
squashed, and it makes more sense to have one pull request rather than
multiple:
* We fall back to the force push methodology where the author amends their
  commits (using e.g. `git commit --amend` or an interactive rebase) then uses
  `git push --force` to update their remote branch.
* If a change to a commit message is requested by a reviewer, it should be
  changed by using an interactive rebase or `git commit --amend` followed by a
  force push.
